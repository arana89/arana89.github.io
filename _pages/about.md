![bixby brige](/assets/images/about_me.jpg){: .align-right} Hello and welcome to my blog!  

I was born and raised in New Jersey before moving to Los Angeles for graduate school. I got my PhD in physics, with research focused in [coherent diffraction imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherent_diffraction_imaging).
A large part of my time in grad school was spent developing and implementing algorithms for computational image reconstruction. I also traveled to many synchrotron facilities across the country (primarily [ALS](https://als.lbl.gov/)) to do x-ray imaging experiments. Feel free to take a look at my [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=48vmZ5IAAAAJ) for more details.

I will use this blog to discuss the projects I am working on as I apply my academic experience to interesting problems in data science and machine learning. To contact me, see the links in the sidebar.
